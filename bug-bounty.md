# Hexagonical Bug Bounty

We make things. Sometimes they break. That’s where *you* come in.

If you find a bug, vulnerability, or just something plain weird in any of our tools, apps, or pages — let us know! We might even reward you (and your team) with **ice cream.**

### How to Get Ice Cream

We hand out rewards at our discretion — but here’s how to maximize your chances:

Submit a **clear and helpful bug report** that includes:

* 🔍 **What the issue is** – What doesn’t work or what it exposes.
* 🧭 **How to reproduce it** – Step-by-step instructions.
* 📍 **What app/page it affects.**
* 🖼️ **Screenshots or videos (if possible).**

Cool, right? Just email your report to: **[ice-cream@hexagonical.ch](mailto:ice-cream@hexagonical.ch)**

### Scope: Where You Can Hunt

You're allowed to test and report bugs for the following platforms:

* 🏠 [Hexagonical Homepage](https://hexagonical.ch)
* 🧠 [HackDB](https://hackdb.hexagonical.ch)

Please don’t test anything not listed here (yet).

### Out of Scope

To keep things fun *and* fair, we don’t reward reports for:

* UI alignment issues or typos
* Outdated browsers or third-party bugs
* Spam or social engineering
* Rate limiting or brute-force attempts

### How do i get the money?
We have two main ways of transfer:
- Bank transfer
- Revolut

### 🙏 Final Notes

We take security seriously. We appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve our platforms. All reports are reviewed manually, so give us a little time.

Now go forth and break things! (ethically, of course.)
